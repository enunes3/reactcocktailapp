Introduction:
The cocktail app began as a place that the user can type in whatever cocktail drink they would like to make and it would render the cocktails name, type of category including if it's alcoholic, type of glass it should be poured into, instructions on how to make it, and last but not least, ingredients. 

Technologies used:
ReactJS
HTML5
CSS3
Javascript/JSX
API
    
Approach:
Took one step at a time and tried wire-framing it on my own and tried each to do each component solo and and see if it would render what I needed it to. 

Technical Challenges:
If you pay special attention to the SingleCocktail.js, you would notice that when fetching the values for the drinks that it is very lengthy and it is very tedious to input each value to make sure that everything comes out correctly.

Improvements I would like to make:
*  I would like to go back and be able to render cocktails either based on ingredients that the user has inputted
* As well as adding the proper measurements to the single cocktail component  
* CSS styling (wish I had more time to style it a bit differently)
